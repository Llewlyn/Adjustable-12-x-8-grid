# ALIT - A large-image tiler

This is a utility that I wrote to help me with my work. It consists of a simple
graphical interface which allows a user to tile a (very large) image 
in a timely manner. 
Professional graphic editors possess
similar features, though I was surprised to learn that no commercial 
software really does what I need, which is the following:

- Load and tile very large TIFF images (~700 Mb) in a few seconds. 
- To easily draw, drag, and resize grids to conveniently choose the tiling pattern.
- To be able to save files following the labels of a 96-well plates 
(commonly used in biology). 

The screenshot gives you an idea of what the software accomplishes and how 
it works.

## Installation
The software achieves the following goals.

draw and manipulates grids of 
variable size. Grids dynamically follow mouse cursor as being placed, can be 
dragged by the edges and rotated by the corners. Dynamical resizing is 
also possible (by clicking on the little square). 


Once a grid is placed, the user 
This script is part of an interface of a more complex  software that I am
 currently writing. The software aims to automatically count microbial 
 colonies from 
 images obtained by spotting a 96-well plate  (commonly used in microbiology
  wet lab). Hence,
 the default grid size is 12 x 8.  


Enjoy!
