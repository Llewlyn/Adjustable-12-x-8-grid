# ALIT - A large-image tiler

This is a utility that I wrote to help me with my work. It consists of a simple
graphical interface which allows a user to tile a (very large) image 
in a timely manner. 
Professional graphic editors possess
similar features, though I was surprised to learn that no commercial 
software really does what I need, which is the following:

- Load and tile very large TIFF images (~700 Mb) in a few seconds. 
- To easily draw, drag, and resize grids to conveniently choose the tiling pattern.
- To be able to save files following the labels of a 96-well plates 
(commonly used in biology). 

The screenshot gives you an idea of what the software accomplishes and how 
it works.
